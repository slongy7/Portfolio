# Portfolio
My Portfolio Website

This project had me begin my Portfolio website.  This needed to include details such as links to my completed projects, contact information, and a picture or avatar that represented myself.

Usage
This website should and will be used in my future job hunt and also will be used to keep track of my completed projects and tasks.

Bugs
I had some issues with placing my headshot where I want it.  I also had issues with linking up on the same page when you click on my links in the "Title" portion, as well as the boxes on the right side.  

Positives
I plan on studying up on how to line up each of the different sections to make my website more visually accepted.  I am proud of my contact information at the bottom of the page, as it took me a while to figure out how to have it maintain itself at the bottom.  I'm very pleased with the set up that I do have, and am excited to continue to work on this to use it for myself in the future.

Credits
I had help from several of my study group members:
